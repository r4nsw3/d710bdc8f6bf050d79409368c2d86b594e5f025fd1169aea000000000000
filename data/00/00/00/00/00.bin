  |   Tales spread of far off isles with mysteries waiting to be            |
  |   discovered.                                                           |

  |   Rulers will need all the strength of their subjects to sail away      |
  |   and find new kingdoms in these New Lands.                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Kingdom: New Lands builds upon the award-winning gameplay and         |
  |   mystery of Kingdom by introducing an abundance of new content to      |
  |   the IGF-nominated title while maintaining the simplicity and depth    |
  |   that legions of monarchs have come to experience and enjoy. Travel    |
  |   to the New Lands and welcome the deluge of new mounts, merchants,     |
  |   and vagrants that call these isles home, but be wary of the new       |
  |   obstacles that threaten your arrival - for not just the greedy        |
  |   creatures block your way but even the environment itself can defeat   |
  |   you.                                                                  |

  |   Kingdom: New Lands asks you to puzzle things out on your own.         |
  |   You'll come across items, NPCs, and mysterious statues to help you    |
  |   but you'll have to figure out just how exactly they'll aide you in    |
  |   building and defending your Kingdom.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
